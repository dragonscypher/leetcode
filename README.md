# Weekly Leetcode Sync

This repository automatically syncs my LeetCode submissions weekly using the [LeetCode Sync GitHub Action](https://github.com/joshcai/leetcode-sync). Each problem is organized into a separate folder, making it easy to browse and track my progress.

## Features
- Automatically syncs accepted LeetCode solutions every Sunday at 12:00 midnight MST (7:00 AM UTC).
- Saves solutions in organized folders for each problem.
- Tracks my coding progress over time, including the number of problems solved and languages used.
